# Requirements for the 'core' submodule
#
# These requirements are missing the psycopg2 package whose installation
# is complicated by having two versions (psycopg2-binary and psycopg2)
# See https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/674
# and https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2018/02/08/psycopg-274-released/
# 
# This file lists all the requirements except for the psycopg2 requirement
# which is specified separately in requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
