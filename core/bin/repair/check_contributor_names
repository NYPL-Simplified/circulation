"""
Goes through the database and checks that Contributor objects' sort_name
properties make sense in light of their display_name values.  If sort_names
need fixing, then has two options:
- Auto-performs minor fixes, such as placing a comma.
- Creates Complaint objects in the database to ask a human to make the more
serious fixes, such as when a sort_name is a transliteration of the display_name.

Can be called like so:

    python bin/repair/check_contributor_names \
      --identifier-type 'RBDigital ID' \
      9781453202715 > rbdigital_contributors_repair.csv

which generates a report file that lists the contributors affected, and whether their names
were fixed or complained about.
