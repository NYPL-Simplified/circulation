Most of the novel moves at a stately pace, even the most emotional peaks of the love story, and Stevenson delivers it with the measured cadence it demands. She isn't quite as strong when speaking the male dialogue, but when she's speaking as any of the female characters--especially the silly, breathy ones like Lydia or Mrs. Bennet--she strikes the perfect tone. However, this abridgment leaves much to be desired. Some of Austen's wittiest lines are cut, and so much is lost from some interactions that several characters come off far more flatly than written.

Fabe\u2019s collages overlay bright, watercolor-washed scenes with retro cut-paper figures and objects sampled from fashion magazines from the 1930s to the \u201950s. Accompanying each tableau is a quote from the <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> passage that inspired it. Like Austen\u2019s book, Fabe\u2019s work explores arcane customs of beauty and courtship, pageantry and social artifice: in one collage, a housewife holds a tray of drinks while a man sits happily with a sandwich in hand in the distance. While tinged with irony and more than a dash of social commentary, the collages nevertheless have a spirit of glee and evidence deep reverence for the novel. As Fabe describes in a preface, Austen \u201cwas a little bit mean\u2014the way real people are mean\u2014so there are both heroes and nincompoops. Family is both beloved and annoying. That is Austen\u2019s genius, her ability to describe people in all their frailty and humor.\u201d This is a sweet and visually appealing homage. <em></em></p>", "source": "<a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com\" target=\"blank\"><img src=\"https://images.contentreserve.com/pw_logo.png\" alt=\"Publisher's Weekly\" border=\"0\" /></a>", "premium": true}], "crossRefId": 479501, "isPublicPerformanceAllowed": false, "mediaType": "Audiobook", "starRating": 4.5, "languages": [{"code": "en", "name": "English"}], "edition": "Unabridged", "isOwnedByCollections": true, "formats": [{"partCount": 11, "rights": [{"type": "PlayOnPC", "value": 1}, {"type": "PlayOnPCCount", "value": -1}, {"type": "BurnToCD", "value": 1}, {"type": "BurnToCDCount", "value": -1}, {"type": "PlayOnPM", "value": 1}, {"type": "TransferToSDMI", "value": 1}, {"type": "TransferToNonSDMI", "value": 1}, {"type": "TransferCount", "value": -1}, {"type": "CollaborativePlay", "value": 0}, {"type": "PublicPerformance", "value": 0}, {"type": "TranscodeToAAC", "value": 1}], "fileName": "PrideandPrejudice", "fileSize": 355553350, "samples": [{"url": "https://excerpts.cdn.overdrive.com/FormatType-25/2389-1/479501-PrideAndPrejudice.wma", "source": "Introduction", "formatType": "audiobook-wma"}, {"url": "https://excerpts.cdn.overdrive.com/FormatType-425/2389-1/479501-PrideAndPrejudice.mp3", "source": "Part 1", "formatType": "audiobook-mp3"}, {"url": "https://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615&.epub-sample.overdrive.com", "source": "Part 1", "formatType": "audiobook-overdrive"}], "onSaleDate": "11/15/2010", "id": "audiobook-mp3", "name": "OverDrive MP3 Audiobook"}, {"partCount": 0, "fileName": "PrideandPrejudice", "fileSize": 355506882, "samples": [{"url": "https://excerpts.cdn.overdrive.com/FormatType-25/2389-1/479501-PrideAndPrejudice.wma", "source": "Introduction", "formatType": "audiobook-wma"}, {"url": "https://excerpts.cdn.overdrive.com/FormatType-425/2389-1/479501-PrideAndPrejudice.mp3", "source": "Part 1", "formatType": "audiobook-mp3"}, {"url": "https://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615&.epub-sample.overdrive.com", "source": "Part 1", "formatType": "audiobook-overdrive"}], "onSaleDate": "11/15/2010", "id": "audiobook-overdrive", "name": "OverDrive Listen"}], "sortTitle": "Pride and Prejudice", "images": {"cover150Wide": {"href": "https://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-150/2389-1/137/14F/86/{13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615}Img150.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "cover300Wide": {"href": "https://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-400/2389-1/137/14F/86/{13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615}Img400.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "cover": {"href": "https://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-100/2389-1/{13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615}Img100.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "thumbnail": {"href": "https://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-200/2389-1/{13714F86-7A9C-4BA6-80B4-BC8A83DE8615}Img200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "isPublicDomain": false, "subjects": [{"value": "Classic Literature"}, {"value": "Fiction"}], "creators": [{"fileAs": "Austen, Jane", "role": "Author", "name": "Jane Austen"}, {"fileAs": "Kellgren, Kate", "role": "Narrator", "name": "Kate Kellgren"}], "shortDescription": "<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is one of the most beloved novels of all time.
