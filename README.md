# Library Simplified Circulation Manager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL-Simplified/circulation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL-Simplified/circulation)

This is the Circulation Manager for [Library Simplified](http://www.librarysimplified.org/). The circulation manager is the main connection between a library's collection and Library Simplified's various client-side applications. It handles user authentication, combines licensed works with open access content, pulls in updated book information from the [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler), and serves up available books in appropriately organized OPDS feeds.

It depends on the [LS Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.
