# Library Simplified Circulation Manager
![Build Status](https://github.com/nypl-simplified/circulation/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/tterb/PlayMusic.svg?style=flat)]()

Default Branch: `develop`

This is the Circulation Manager for [Library Simplified](https://www.librarysimplified.org/). The Circulation Manager is the main connection between a library's collection and Library Simplified's various client-side applications. It handles user authentication, combines licensed works with open access content, pulls in updated book information from the [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler), and serves up available books in appropriately organized OPDS feeds.

It depends on [Library Simplified Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.

## Installation

* [How to install Docker images](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment:-Quickstart-with-Docker)
* [How to set up a development environment](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions)
* Two sets of Ansible playbooks are in development: [One developed by Minitex](https://github.com/Minitex/ansible-playbook-libsimple) and [a derivative developed by Amigos Library Services](https://github.com/alsrlw/ansible-playbook-libsimple)

## Generating Documentation

Code documentation using Sphinx can be found on this repo's [Github Pages](http://nypl-simplified.github.io/circulation/index.html). It currently documents this repo's `api` directory, `scripts` file, and the `core` submodule directory. The configuration for the documentation can be found in `/docs`.

Travis CI handles generating the `.rst` source files, generating the HTML static site, and deploying the build to the `gh-pages` branch.

To view the documentation _locally_, go into the `/docs` directory and run `make html`. This will generate the .rst source files and build the static site in `/docs/build/html`.

## Usage with Docker

Check out the [Docker README](/docker/README.md) in the `/docker` directory for in-depth information on optionally running and developing the Circulation Manager locally with Docker, or for deploying the Circulation Manager with Docker.
