# Library Simplified Circulation Manager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL-Simplified/circulation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NYPL-Simplified/circulation)

This is the Circulation Manager for [Library Simplified](http://www.librarysimplified.org/). The circulation manager is the main connection between a library's collection and Library Simplified's various client-side applications. It handles user authentication, combines licensed works with open access content, pulls in updated book information from the [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler), and serves up available books in appropriately organized OPDS feeds.

It depends on the [LS Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.

## Installation

* [How to install Docker images](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment:-Quickstart-with-Docker)
* [How to set up a development environment](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions)
* Two sets of Ansible playbooks are in development: [One developed by Minitex](https://github.com/Minitex/ansible-playbook-libsimple) and [a derivative developed by Amigos Library Services](https://github.com/alsrlw/ansible-playbook-libsimple)

## Generating Documenation

Code documentation using Sphinx can be found on [readthedocs.org](). It currently documents this repo's `api` directory, `scripts` file, and the `core` directory submodule. The configuration for the documentation can be found in `/docs`.

There are two steps to building the documentation: generate the `.rst` files from the codebase and generate the html static site (not to be committed). Inside the `/docs` directory, run:

```
   $ sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ .. ../tests/* ../core/tests/* ../integration_tests/*
```

```
   $ make html
```

The `sphinx-apidoc` command will generate a new set of `.rst` files. Currently, there is no automatic way to generate them using continuous integration so they will need to be generated manually.

Run the `make` command to _locally_ generate the documentation `/docs/html` which can be viewed in a browser. `readthedoc` runs this commands automatically when a new commit is pushed.
