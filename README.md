# Library Simplified Circulation Manager

![Build Status](https://github.com/nypl-simplified/circulation/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/nypl-simplified/circulation.svg?style=flat)]()

## Overview

Default Branch: `develop`

This is the Circulation Manager for [Library Simplified](https://www.librarysimplified.org/). The Circulation Manager is the main connection between a library's collection and Library Simplified's various client-side applications, including SimplyE. It handles user authentication, combines licensed works with open access content, pulls in updated book information from the [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler), and serves up available books in appropriately organized OPDS feeds.

It depends on [Library Simplified Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.

## Installation

- [How to install Docker images](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment:-Quickstart-with-Docker)
- [How to set up a development environment](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions)
- Two sets of Ansible playbooks are in development: [One developed by Minitex](https://github.com/Minitex/ansible-playbook-libsimple) and [a derivative developed by Amigos Library Services](https://github.com/alsrlw/ansible-playbook-libsimple)

## Git Branch Workflow

| Branch  | Python Version |
| ------- | -------------- |
| develop | Python 3       |
| main    | Python 3       |
| python2 | Python 2       |

The default branch is `develop` and that's the working branch that should be used when branching off for bug fixes or new features. Once a feature branch pull request is merged into `develop`, the changes can be merged to `main` to create releases.

Python 2 stopped being supported after January 1st, 2020 but there is still a `python2` branch which can be used. As of May 2021, development will be done in the `develop` and `main` branches.

There are additional protected branches that are used for _NYPL-specific_ deployments to keep in mind.

| Branch                 |
| ---------------------- |
| nypl-deploy-qa         |
| nypl-deploy-production |
| openebooks-deploy-qa   |
| openebooks-deploy-qa   |
| bpl-deploy-qa          |
| bpl-deploy-production  |

## Set Up

### Python Set Up

If you do not have Python 3 installed, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\* to install it by running the command `$ brew install python3`.

\*If you do not yet have Homebrew, you can install it by running the following:

```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

While you're at it, go ahead and install the following required dependencies:

- `$ brew install pkg-config libffi`
- `$ brew install libxmlsec1`
- `$ brew install libjpeg`

You will need to set up a local virtual environment to install packages and run the project. If you haven't done so before, use pip to install virtualenv – `$ pip install virtualenv` – before creating the virtual environment in the root of the circulation repository:

```sh
$ python -m venv env
```

As mentioned above, this application depends on [Library Simplified Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule. To set that up, in the repository, run:

- `$ git submodule init`
- `$ git submodule update`

### Python Version

It is important to know that only certain versions of Python 3 will work with this application. One such version is Python 3.6.5. Check to see which version you currently have installed by running `$ python -V`.

If you're using a version of Python that doesn't work, install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) using command `$ curl https://pyenv.run | bash`, then install the version of Python you want to work with, ie `$ pyenv install python3.6.5`, and then run `$ pyenv global 3.6.5`. Check the current version again with `$ python -V` to make sure it's correct before proceeding.

### Elasticsearch Set Up

The circulation manager requires Elasticsearch. If you don't have Elasticsearch, check out instructions in the [Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions), or simply read on.

1. Download it [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-8-6).
2. `cd` into the `elasticsearch-[version number]` directory.
3. Run `$ sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-icu`
4. Run `$ ./bin/elasticsearch`.
5. You may be prompted to download [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). If so, go ahead and do so.
6. Check `http://localhost:9200` to make sure the Elasticsearch server is running.

### Database Set Up

The databases should be created next. To find instructions for how to do so, check out the [Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions), or simply read on.

1. Download and install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) if you don't have it already.
2. Use the command `$ psql` to access the Postgresql client.
3. Within the session, run the following commands, adding your own password in lieu of the [password] placeholders:

```sh
CREATE DATABASE simplified_circulation_test;
CREATE DATABASE simplified_circulation_dev;

CREATE USER simplified with password '[password]';
grant all privileges on database simplified_circulation_dev to simplified;

CREATE USER simplified_test with password '[password]';
grant all privileges on database simplified_circulation_test to simplified_test;

--Add pgcrypto to any circulation manager databases.
\c simplified_circulation_dev
create extension pgcrypto;
\c simplified_circulation_test
create extension pgcrypto;
```

Then, add the following database URLS as environment variables at the end of the `/env/bin/activate` file within the circulation repo, including the password you created earlier:

```
export SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE="postgres://simplified:[password]@localhost:5432/simplified_circulation_dev"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE="postgres://simplified_test:[password]@localhost:5432/simplified_circulation_test"
```

### Running the Application

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
```

And install the dependencies:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run the application with:

```sh
$ python app.py
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:6500/`.

### Note on HTTP/S in development

When deployed, the application should be run behind a secure proxy responsible for SSL termination. 

While developing locally, if it becomes necessary to observe app code serving HTTP/S requests, it is possible to start the Flask/Werkzeug development server with an ad-hoc SSL context (see [werkzeug.serving.run_simple()](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/serving/#werkzeug.serving.run_simple) for more details). These ad-hoc certs work because of the pyopenssl package.

To have the server listen for HTTP/S requests, supply an https:// URL on start:

```sh
$ python app.py https://localhost:6500/
```

Also note that this does not fully replicate secure requests as they would appear on a deployed app instance. In particular, the X-Forwarded-* headers may be different, since you are hitting the application server directly rather than through one or more proxy layers.

### Adding Collections to the Circulation Manager Admin

If you are working on the Circulation Manager Admin, and need to add collections of books to your local app for testing purposes, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a0QNWTvt9NKChr8TcLJ3G1PfpBCKV6hC2JuB5Yk_CYY/edit?usp=sharing).

### Python Installation Issues

When running the `pip install ...` command, you may run into installation issues. The [Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions) instructions say to install some packages through brew such as `libxmlsec1`. On newer macos machines, you may encounter an error such as:

```sh
error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit code 1
  ----------------------------------------
ERROR: Failed building wheel for xmlsec
Failed to build dm.xmlsec.binding xmlsec
ERROR: Could not build wheels for xmlsec which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly
```

This typically happens after installing packages through brew and then running the `pip install` command.

This [blog post](https://mbbroberg.fun/clang-error-in-pip/) explains and shows a fix for this issue. Start by trying the `xcode-select --install` command. If it does not work, you can try adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file, depending on what you use:

```sh
export CPPFLAGS="-DXMLSEC_NO_XKMS=1"
```

## Generating Documentation

Code documentation using Sphinx can be found on this repo's [Github Pages](http://nypl-simplified.github.io/circulation/index.html). It currently documents this repo's `api` directory, `scripts` file, and the `core` submodule directory. The configuration for the documentation can be found in `/docs`.

Github Actions handles generating the `.rst` source files, generating the HTML static site, and deploying the build to the `gh-pages` branch.

To view the documentation _locally_, go into the `/docs` directory and run `make html`. This will generate the .rst source files and build the static site in `/docs/build/html`.

## Continuous Integration

This project runs all the unit tests through Github Actions for new pull requests and when merging into the default `develop` branch. The relevant file can be found in `.github/workflows/test.yml`. When contributing updates or fixes, it's required for the test Github Action to pass for all python 3 environments. Run the `tox` command locally before pushing changes to make sure you find any failing tests before committing them.

As mentioned above, Github Actions is also used to build and deploy Sphinx documentation to Github Pages. The relevant file can be found in `.github/workflows/docks.yml`.

## Testing

The Github Actions CI service runs the unit tests against Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 automatically using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To run `pytest` unit tests locally, install `tox`.

```sh
pip install tox
```

Tox has an environment for each python version and an optional `-docker` factor that will automatically use docker to
deploy service containers used for the tests. You can select the environment you would like to test with the tox `-e`
flag.

### Environments

| Environment | Python Version |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| py36        | Python 3.6     |
| py37        | Python 3.7     |
| py38        | Python 3.8     |

All of these environments are tested by default when running tox. To test one specific environment you can use the `-e`
flag.

Test Python 3.8

```
tox -e py38
```

You need to have the Python versions you are testing against installed on your local system. `tox` searches the system for installed Python versions, but does not install new Python versions. If `tox` doesn't find the Python version its looking for it will give an `InterpreterNotFound` errror.

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a useful tool to install multiple Python versions, if you need to install missing Python versions in your system for local testing.

### Docker

If you install `tox-docker` tox will take care of setting up all the service containers necessary to run the unit tests
and pass the correct environment variables to configure the tests to use these services. Using `tox-docker` is not required, but it is the recommended way to run the tests locally, since it runs the tests in the same way they are run on the Github Actions CI server.

```
pip install tox-docker
```

The docker functionality is included in a `docker` factor that can be added to the environment. To run an environment
with a particular factor you add it to the end of the environment.

Test with Python 3.8 using docker containers for the services.

```
tox -e py38-docker
```

### Local services

If you already have elastic search or postgres running locally, you can run them instead by setting the
following environment variables:

- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE`
- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_ELASTICSEARCH`

Make sure the ports and usernames are updated to reflect the local configuration.

```sh
# Set environment variables
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE="postgres://simplified_test:test@localhost:9005/simplified_circulation_test"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_ELASTICSEARCH="http://localhost:9006"

# Run tox
tox -e py38
```

### Override `pytest` arguments

If you wish to pass additional arguments to `pytest` you can do so through `tox`. The default argument passed to `pytest`
is `tests`, however you can override this. Every argument passed after a `--` to the `tox` command line will the passed
to `pytest`, overriding the default.

Only run the `test_cdn` tests with Python 3.6 using docker.

```sh
tox -e py36-docker -- tests/test_google_analytics_provider.py
```

## Usage with Docker

Check out the [Docker README](/docker/README.md) in the `/docker` directory for in-depth information on optionally running and developing the Circulation Manager locally with Docker, or for deploying the Circulation Manager with Docker.

## Debugging

If you are served an error message on the admin home screen, you may need to run `npm install` in the api/admin directory of the circulation repo. If you're running the application locally, you can also try running the same command in the root directory of the circulation-web repo.

The latter command will only work if the circulation-web and circulation repos are linked using npm link. You can find more information on how to do this in the circulation-web repo's [README](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation-web/blob/main/README.md).
