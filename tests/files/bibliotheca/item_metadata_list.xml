    <SubTitle>How the Inevitable Rise in the Price of Gasoline Will Change Our Lives for the Better</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Steiner, Christopher</Authors>
    <Description>Imagine an everyday world in which the price of gasoline (and oil) continues to go up, and up, and up. Think about the immediate impact that would have on our lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Of course, everybody already knows how about gasoline has affected our driving habits. People can't wait to junk their gas-guzzling SUVs for a new Prius. But there are more, not-so-obvious changes on the horizon that Chris Steiner tracks brilliantly in this provocative work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Consider the following societal changes: people who own homes in far-off suburbs will soon realize that there's no longer any market for their houses (reason: nobody wants to live too far away because it's too expensive to commute to work). Telecommuting will begin to expand rapidly. Trains will become the mode of national transportation (as it used to be) as the price of flying becomes prohibitive. Families will begin to migrate southward as the price of heating northern homes in the winter is too pricey. Cheap everyday items that are comprised of plastic will go away because of the rising price to produce them (plastic is derived from oil). And this is just the beginning of a huge and overwhelming domino effect that our way of life will undergo in the years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Steiner, an engineer by training before turning to journalism, sees how this simple but constant rise in oil and gas prices will totally re-structure our lifestyle. But what may  be surprising to readers is that all of these changes may not be negative - but actually will usher in some new and very promising aspects of our society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; Steiner will probe how the liberation of technology and innovation, triggered by climbing gas prices, will change our lives. The book may start as an alarmist's exercise.... but don't be misled. The future will be exhilarating.</Description>

    <Title>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</Title>
    <SubTitle/>
    <Authors>Twain, Mark</Authors>
    <Description>Here is the story of Tom, Huck, Becky, and Aunt Polly; a tale of adventures, pranks, playing hookey, and summertime fun. Written by the author sometimes called "the Lincoln of literature," &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&lt;/i&gt; was surprisingly neither a critical nor a financial success when it was first published in 1876. It was Mark Twain's first novel. However, since then &lt;i&gt;Tom Sawyer&lt;/i&gt; has become his most popular work, enjoying dramatic, film, and even Broadway musical interpretations.</Description>

    <Title>Thelonious Monk</Title>
    <SubTitle>The Life and Times of an American Original</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Kelley, Robin</Authors>
    <Description>THELONIOUS MONK is the critically acclaimed, gripping saga of an artist&#8217;s struggle to &#8220;make it&#8221; without compromising his musical vision. It is a story that, like its subject, reflects the tidal ebbs and flows of American history in the twentieth century. To his fans, he was the ultimate hipster; to his detractors, he was temperamental, eccentric, taciturn, or childlike. His angular melodies and dissonant harmonies shook the jazz world to its foundations, ushering in the birth of &#8220;bebop&#8221; and establishing Monk as one of America&#8217;s greatest com&#173;posers. Elegantly written and rich with humor and pathos, &lt;i&gt;Thelonious Monk &lt;/i&gt;is the definitive work on modern jazz&#8217;s most original composer.</Description>

    <Title>The Grave Maurice</Title>
    <SubTitle/>
    <Authors>Grimes, Martha</Authors>
    <Description>"Chew on this," says Melrose Plant to Richard Jury, who's in the hospital being driven crazy by Hannibal, a nurse who likes to speculate on his chances for survival. Jury could use a good story, preferably one not ending with his own demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant tells Jury of something he overheard in The Grave Maurice, a pub near the hospital. A woman told an intriguing story about a girl named Nell Ryder, granddaughter to the owner of the Ryder Stud Farm in Cambridgeshire, who went missing more than a year before and has never been found. What is especially interesting to Plant is that Nell is also the daughter of Jury's surgeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Nell's disappearance isn't the only mystery at the Ryder farm. A woman has been found dead on the track-a woman who was a stranger even to the Ryders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not to Plant. She's the woman he saw in The Grave Maurice. Together with Jury, Nell's family, and the Cambridgeshire police, Plant embarks on a search to find Nell and bring her home. But is there more to their mission than just restoring a fifteen-year-old girl to her family?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Grave Maurice&lt;/b&gt; is the eighteenth entry in the Richard Jury series and, from its pastoral opening to its calamitous end, is full of the same suspense and humor that devoted readers expect from Martha Grimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</Description>

    <Title>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</Title>
    <SubTitle>What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Hadfield, Chris</Authors>
    <Description>Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-&lt;i&gt;and enjoy every moment of it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth&lt;/i&gt;, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counterintuitive lessons: don't visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Col. Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.</Description>

    <SubTitle/>
    <Authors>Box, C.J.</Authors>
    <Description>A twelve-year-old girl and her younger brother go on the run in the woods of North Idaho, pursued by four men they have just watched commit murder---four men who know exactly who William and Annie are, and who know exactly where their desperate mother is waiting for news of her children&#8217;s fate. Retired cops from Los Angeles, the killers easily persuade the inexperienced sheriff to let them lead the search for the missing children.William and Annie&#8217;s unexpected savior comes in the form of an old-school rancher teetering on the brink of foreclosure. But as one man against four who will stop at nothing to silence their witnesses, Jess Rawlins needs allies, and he knows that one word to the wrong person could seal the fate of the children or their mother. In a town where most of the ranches like his have turned into acres of ranchettes populated by strangers, finding someone to trust won&#8217;t be easy. With true-to-life, unforgettable characters and a ticking-clock plot that spans just over forty-eight hours, C.J. Box has created a thriller that delves into issues close to the heart: the ruthless power of greed over broken ideals, the healing power of community where unlikely heroes find themselves at the crossroads of duty and courage, and the truth about what constitutes a family. In a setting whose awesome beauty is threatened by those who want a piece of it, &lt;i&gt;Blue Heaven&lt;/i&gt; delivers twists and turns until its last breathtaking page.&lt;i&gt;Blue Heaven&lt;/i&gt; is the winner of the 2009 Edgar Award for Best Novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Description>

    <Description>&lt;b&gt; "Highly entertaining...[Hagedorn] is an exceptional storyteller."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Jessica Hagedorn's ferociously entertaining new novel centers on  two women who are neighbors in Manhattan's West Village: Mimi Smith, a  filmmaker whose only screen credit is a notorious low-budget slasher  movie, and Eleanor Delacroix, a legendary, scandalous literary figure  now nearing eighty. Their personal and artistic lives begin to converge  in unexpected ways as Eleanor grieves over the death of her longtime  lover, the renowned painter Yvonne Wilder, and as Mimi confronts the  challenges presented by the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend,  by her newly sober if still somewhat loopy brother, and by her wayward  teenage daughter. &lt;i&gt;Toxicology&lt;/i&gt; is a fearless, playful, and  savagely funny novel about the collision of art, fame, money, love,  desire, and mortality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</Description>

    <Title>A Man to Call My Own</Title>
    <SubTitle>A Novel</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Lindsey, Johanna</Authors>
    <Description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Johanna Lindsey comes a love story as passionate and tumultuous as the old American West, about an heiress who discovers passion in the arms of a Texas cowboy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Amanda and Marian Laton are identical twins but they are as different as night and day. Amanda is beautiful but nasty, and Marian is kind but plain&#8212;purposely so to avoid provoking her spiteful twin's jealousy. When their wealthy father suddenly dies, the two gently reared New England heiresses are sent to live with their aunt on a sprawling Texas ranch. There the twins meet Chad Kinkaid, the cowboy son of a neighboring rancher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Marian is fascinated by Chad's rugged good looks and his sheer masculinity, but she knows that like every other man she and her twin have met, he will pursue Amanda, not her. Chad is indeed beguiled by Amanda's beauty, but soon he begins to see beyond Marian's carefully constructed dowdy fa&#231;ade. Unlike the tame gentlemen back East, after witnessing Marian's taste for adventure, her sense of humor and bravery in the face of danger, Chad finds himself wanting &lt;i&gt;her.&lt;/i&gt; But how can he, a man who's just a cowboy without fancy airs or urbane charm, convince her she's the only woman for him?</Description>

    <Description>With a New Introduction by George Saunders&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book of the Year&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;It is early spring, and Tom has called together his fellow psychologists at the Krakower Institute for their biannual pancake supper&#8212;a chance for likeminded analysts to talk shop and casually unburden themselves over flapjacks. But, as Tom knows (at least subconsciously), his brainy colleagues are a little on edge&#8212;simmering with romantic tension and professional grievance, their stew of conflicting ego and id just might boil to the surface before the pretty waitress brings their next coffee refill. When Tom tries to provoke a food fight, a rival colleague locks him in a therapeutic hold, triggering a transcendent if totally bizarre transformation that will free Tom to confront his greatest pleasures and fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Darkly funny and beautifully written, &lt;i&gt;The Verificationist&lt;/i&gt; confirms Donald Antrim as one of America&#8217;s best and most original authors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Description>

    <Title>If the River Was Whiskey</Title>
    <SubTitle>Stories</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Boyle, T.C.</Authors>
    <Description>In sixteen stories, T.C. Boyle tears through the walls of contemporary society to reveal a world at once comic and tragic, droll and horrific. Boyle introduces us to a death-defying stuntman who rides across the country strapped to the axle of a Peterbilt, and to a retired primatologist who can&#8217;t adjust to the &#8220;civilized&#8221; world. He chronicles the state of romance that requires full-body protection in a disease-conscious age and depicts with aching tenderness the relationship between a young boy and his alcoholic father. These magical and provocative stories mark yet another virtuoso performance from one of America&#8217;s most supple and electric literary inventors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</Description>

    <Title>The Last Supper</Title>
    <SubTitle>A Summer in Italy</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Cusk, Rachel</Authors>
    <Description>Casting off a northern winter and an orderly life, a family decides to sell everything and go to Italy to search for art and its meanings, for freedom from routine, for a different path into the future. The award-winning writer Rachel Cusk describes a three-month journey around the Italy of Raphael and rented villas, of the Piero della Francesca trail and the tourist furnace of Amalfi, of soccer and the simple glories of pasta and gelato.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;With her husband and two children, Cusk uncovers the mystery of a foreign language, the perils and pleasures of unbelonging, and the startling thrill of discovery&#8212;at once historic and intimate. Both sharp and humane in its exploration of the desire to travel and to escape, of art and its inspirations, of beauty and ugliness, and of the challenge of balancing domestic life with creativity, &lt;i&gt;The Last Supper &lt;/i&gt;is an astonishing memoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Description>

    <SubTitle/>
    <Authors>Decker, James K</Authors>
    <Description>&lt;b&gt;Plagued by overpopulation, disease, and starvation, humanity was headed for extinction&#8212;until an alien race called the haan arrived. And then the real trouble began.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&#8217;s been a rough day for Sam Shao. As part of a program that requires humans to act as surrogates to haan infants, Sam has been genetically enhanced to bond with them. So when three soldiers invade her apartment and arrest her guardian for smuggling a dangerous weapon into the country, Sam can sense that something isn&#8217;t right. One of his abductors is a haan masquerading as a human, and the supposedly fragile haan seems to be anything but. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racing through the city slums, trying to stay one step ahead of the mysterious haan soldier, Sam tries to find the man who, in her twenty years, has been the only father she&#8217;s ever known. Could he truly have done what he is accused of? Or did he witness something both human and haan would kill to keep hidden? The only thing certain is that the weapon is real&#8212;and lost now somewhere in a city of millions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting the clock, Sam finds an ally in Nix, a haan envoy devoted to coexisting with humans, or so it seems. But what she really needs are answers. Fast. Or else everything she knows&#8212;and everyone she loves&#8212;will burn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</Description>

    <Title>London 1945</Title>
    <SubTitle>Life in the Debris of War</SubTitle>
    <Authors>Waller, Maureen</Authors>
    <Description>London at the outset of war in 1939 was the greatest city in the world, the heart of the British Empire. By 1945, it was a drab and exhausted city, beginning the long haul back to recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The defiant capital had always been Hitler's prime target. The last months of the war saw the final phase of the battle of London as the enemy unleashed its new vengeance weapons, the flying bombs and rockets. They were terrifying and brought destruction on a vast scale, but fortunately came too late to dent morale seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The people of London were showing the spirit, courage, and resilience that had earned them the admiration of the world during a long siege. In the harshest winter of fifty years, they were living in primitive conditions. Thousands were homeless, living in the Underground and deep shelters. Women lined up for horse meat and were lucky to obtain one egg a month. They besieged emergency coal dumps. Everyone longed for peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The bright new world seemed elusive. As the victory celebrations passed into memory, there were severe hardships and all the problems of post-war adjustment. Women lost the independence the war had lent them, husbands and wives had to learn to live together again, and children had a lot of catching up to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Yet London's loss has often been its opportunity. Its people had eagerly embraced plans for a modern metropolis and an end to poverty. They voted overwhelmingly for a Labour government and the new, fairer social order that was their reward for all they had endured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The year of victory, 1945, represents an important chapter in London's---and Britain's---long history. Acclaimed historian Maureen Waller draws on a rich array of primary sources, letting the people tell their own story, to re-create that moment, bringing to it the social insight at which she excels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Description>

    <Authors>Hess, Joan</Authors>
    <Description>When Claire Malloy's best friend Luanne Bradshaw goes down with a badly sprained ankle, someone must fill in her shoes as Thurberfest beauty Pageant coordinator and usher a bevy of aspiring beauty queen through the two-day event. Enter Claire Malloy to the rescue. But this is one job Claire would gladly be fired from. Now, already fending off a hostile theater owner, and overly-agressive personal trainer, an incontinent show-dog, a fifteen-year-old daughter with more growing pains than she can count, and a talent contest in need of some talent, Claire must face one more problem--someone is trying to kill the reigning Miss Thurberfest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;When a ghastly murder scene signals the culprit's success, Claire's investigative instincts take over, but when she digs too close to the truth, the race is on to discover the killer's identity before Claire herself is crowned the next victim...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Description>
