        it is very useful to have because other identifiers tend to
        change.

        :param authorization_identifier: One or more assigned
        identifiers (usually numeric) the patron may use to identify
        themselves. This may be a list, because patrons may have
        multiple authorization identifiers. For example, an NYPL
        patron may have an NYPL library card, a Brooklyn Public
        Library card, and an IDNYC card: three different barcodes that
        all authenticate the same patron.

        The circulation manager does the best it can to maintain
        continuity of the patron's identity in the face of changes to
        this list. The two assumptions made are:

        1) A patron tends to pick one of their authorization
        identifiers and stick with it until it stops working, rather
        than switching back and forth. This identifier is the one
        stored in Patron.authorization_identifier.

        2) In the absence of any other information, the authorization
        identifier at the _beginning_ of this list is the one that
        should be stored in Patron.authorization_identifier.

        :param username: An identifier (usually alphanumeric) chosen
        by the patron and used to identify themselves.

        :param personal_name: The name of the patron. This information
        is not stored in the circulation manager database but may be
        passed on to the client.

        :param authorization_expires: The date, if any, at which the patron's
        authorization to borrow items from the library expires.

        :param external_type: A string classifying the patron
        according to some library-specific scheme.

        :param fines: A Money object representing the amount the
        patron owes in fines. Note that only the value portion of the
        Money object will be stored in the database; the currency portion
        will be ignored. (e.g. "20 USD" will become 20)

        :param block_reason: A string indicating why the patron is
        blocked from borrowing items. (Even if this is set to None, it
        may turn out the patron cannot borrow items because their card
        has expired or their fines are excessive.)

        :param library_identifier: A string pulled from the ILS that
        is used to determine if this user belongs to the current library.

        :param complete: Does this PatronData represent the most
        complete data we are likely to get for this patron from this
        data source, or is it an abbreviated version of more complete
        data we could get some other way?

    #
    # Each subclass MAY define a value for FLOW_TYPE. This is the URI
    # used to identify the authentication mechanism in Authentication
    # For OPDS documents. The default is used to indicate the Library
    # Simplified variant of OAuth.
    #
    # Each subclass MUST define an attribute called
    # NAME, which is the name used to configure that
    # subclass in the configuration file. Failure to define this
    # attribute will result in an error in the constructor.
    #
    # Each subclass MUST define an attribute called TOKEN_TYPE, which
    # is the name used in the database to distinguish this provider's
    # tokens from other provider's tokens.
    #
    # Each subclass MUST define an attribute called
    # TOKEN_DATA_SOURCE_NAME, which is the name of the DataSource
    # under which bearer tokens for patrons will be registered.

    # Finally, each subclass MUST define an attribute called
    # EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATE_URL. When the patron hits the
    # oauth_authentication_redirect controller, they will be
    # redirected to this URL on the OAuth provider's site.
    #
    # This URL template MUST contain Python variable interpolations
    # for 'client_id', 'oauth_callback_url', 'state'. This way the
    # OAuth provider knows which client is asking to authenticate a
    # user, and it knows to send the client back to our
    # oauth_authentication_callback controller. Finally, the
    # oauth_callback controller can maintain any state from the
    # initial request to oauth_authentication_redirect.
    #
    # As an example, here's the EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATE_URL for the
    # Clever OAuth provider:
    #
