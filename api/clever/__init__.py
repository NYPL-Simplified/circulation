        record through the Clever API.

        This is the only method that has access to a patron's personal
        information as provided by Clever. Here's an inventory of the
        information we process and what happens to it:

        * The Clever 'id' associated with this patron is passed out of
          this method through the PatronData object, and persisted to
          two database fields: 'patrons.external_identifier' and
          'patrons.authorization_identifier'.

          As far as we know, the Clever ID is an opaque reference
          which uniquely identifies a given patron but contains no
          personal information about them.

        * If the patron is a student, their grade level
          ("Kindergarten" through "12") is converted into an Open
          eBooks patron type ("E" for "Early Grades", "M" for "Middle
          Grades", or "H" for "High School"). This is stored in the
          PatronData object returned from this method, and persisted
          to the database field 'patrons.external_type'. If the patron
          is not a student, their Open eBooks patron type is set to
          "A" for "All Access").

          This system does not track a patron's grade level or store
          it in the database. Only the coarser-grained Open eBooks
          patron type is tracked. This is used to show age-appropriate
          books to the patron.

        * The internal Clever ID of the patron's school is used to
          make a _second_ Clever API request to get information about
          the school. From that, we get the school's NCES ID, which we
          cross-check against data we've gathered separately to
          validate the school's Title I status. The school ID and NCES
          ID are not stored in the PatronData object or persisted to
          the database. Any patron who ends up in the database is
          presumed to have passed this check.

        To summarize, an opaque ID associated with the patron is
        persisted to the database, as is a coarse-grained indicator of
        the patron's age. No other information about the patron makes
        it out of this method.

        :return: A ProblemDetail if there's a problem. Otherwise, a PatronData
            with the data listed above.
