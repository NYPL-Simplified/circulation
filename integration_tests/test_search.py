# These integration tests were written based primarily on real
# searches made in October 2018 against NYPL's circulation
# manager. Theoretically, most of the tests that pass on NYPL's index
# should pass when run against the search index of any public library
# with a similarly sized collection.
#
# These guidelines were used when writing the tests:
#
# * A search for a specific book should return that book as the first result.
#   This is true whether or not the search query names the book.
# * Results for a series search should be dominated by books from that series.
# * Results for a person search should be dominated by books by or (in some
#   cases) about that person.
# * A search for a topic or genre should return books on that topic or
#   in that genre.
#
# It's possible for a test to fail not because of a problem with the
# search engine but because a library's collection is incomplete.  The
# tests are written to minimize the chances that this will happen
# unnecessarily. (e.g. the search for "dirtbike" checks for books
# filed under certain subjects, not specific titles).
#
# Run the tests with this command:
#
# $ nosetests integration_tests/test_search.py
